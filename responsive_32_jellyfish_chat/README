## üß† How It Works

The jellyfish is built using layered `<div>` elements styled to form:
- A **bell** (top dome)
- A **rim** (lower edge of the bell)
- **Frills** (soft tissue below the rim)
- Multiple **tentacles** that sway and wobble independently

Animations are controlled with keyframes:
- `pulse` ‚Äì simulates contraction and relaxation of the bell  
- `tentacleWave` ‚Äì creates smooth tentacle sway  
- `tentacleWobble` ‚Äì adds subtle horizontal oscillation  
- `floatAround` ‚Äì makes the jellyfish drift across the screen
