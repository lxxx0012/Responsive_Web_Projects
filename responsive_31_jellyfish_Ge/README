Project Overview

This is a simple, captivating animation built entirely with HTML and CSS. It features a glowing, 
neon jellyfish that slowly floats and pulses across a dark, deep-sea-like background, demonstrating 
the creative power of CSS keyframes and box-shadow effects.

Key Features:
Pure CSS Animation: No JavaScript required for movement or glow.

Neon Effect: Created using multiple, layered box-shadow properties on the blue hue.

Floating Motion: Uses the @keyframes rule to simulate gentle, organic underwater movement.

Pulsing Glow: The jellyfish subtly brightens and scales, adding to the lifelike effect.

Code Highlights
The core of the animation is defined by three key @keyframes rules in style.css:
Keyframe, Target Element, Purpose
float, .jellyfish-container, "Creates the slow, sweeping, vertical movement across the screen."
glow, .jellyfish, Subtly changes the element's overall brightness for a flicker effect.
pulse, .bell, Slightly scales the jellyfish bell to mimic organic expansion and contraction.
