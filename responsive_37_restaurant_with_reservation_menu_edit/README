# üçΩÔ∏è The Culinary Corner - Full-Stack Restaurant Application

This project is a dynamic Single-Page Application (SPA) designed for a modern restaurant. It features a customer-facing menu, a reservation form, and a secure backend administration dashboard for managing inventory and bookings.

The application is built using the **MERN stack without React** (MongoDB, Express, Node.js), providing a robust, permanent, and secure data solution.

## üöÄ Features

### Customer-Facing
* **Dynamic Menu Display:** Fetches the current, visible menu items directly from the MongoDB database.
* **Reservation Form:** Submits booking details to the secure API.
* **Single-Page Navigation:** Seamless switching between Menu, Reservations, and Contact views using client-side JavaScript.

### Administration
* **Secure API Endpoints:** Menu editing and reservation viewing endpoints are protected by server-side logic (middleware).
* **Menu Management:** Administrators can add, delete, and toggle the visibility of menu items.
* **Reservation Viewer:** (Future feature) Securely view all customer reservations.
